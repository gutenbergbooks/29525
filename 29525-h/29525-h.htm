<h1><big>the<br />
Leech</big></h1>

<p class="rgt"><big><b>Illustrated by CONNELL</b></big></p>

<h2>By PHILLIPS BARBEE</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b><i>A visitor should be fed, but
this one could eat you out of
house and home ... literally!</i></b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> leech was waiting for
food. For millennia it had
been drifting across the
vast emptiness of space. Without
consciousness, it had spent the
countless centuries in the void
between the stars. It was unaware
when it finally reached a sun.
Life-giving radiation flared
around the hard, dry spore.
Gravitation tugged at it.</p>

<p>A planet claimed it, with other
stellar debris, and the leech fell,
still dead-seeming within its
tough spore case.</p>

<p>One speck of dust among many,
the winds blew it around the
Earth, played with it, and let it
fall.</p>

<p>On the ground, it began to stir.
Nourishment soaked in, permeating
the spore case. It grew&mdash;and
fed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Frank Conners</span> came up
on the porch and coughed
twice. "Say, pardon me, Professor,"
he said.</p>

<p>The long, pale man didn't stir
from the sagging couch. His horn-rimmed
glasses were perched on
his forehead, and he was snoring
very gently.</p>

<p>"I'm awful sorry to disturb
you," Conners said, pushing back
his battered felt hat. "I know it's
your restin' week and all, but
there's something damned funny
in the ditch."</p>

<p>The pale man's left eyebrow
twitched, but he showed no other
sign of having heard.</p>

<p>Frank Conners coughed again,
holding his spade in one purple-veined
hand. "Didja hear me,
Professor?"</p>

<p>"Of course I heard you," Micheals
said in a muffled voice, his
eyes still closed. "You found a
pixie."</p>

<p>"A what?" Conners asked,
squinting at Micheals.</p>

<p>"A little man in a green suit.
Feed him milk, Conners."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I think it's a rock."</p>

<p>Micheals opened one eye and
focused it in Conners' general direction.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry about it,"
Conners said. Professor Micheals'
resting week was a ten-year-old
custom, and his only eccentricity.
All winter Micheals taught anthropology,
worked on half a
dozen committees, dabbled in
physics and chemistry, and still
found time to write a book a year.
When summer came, he was
tired.</p>

<p>Arriving at his worked-out New
York State farm, it was his invariable
rule to do absolutely nothing
for a week. He hired Frank
Conners to cook for that week
and generally make himself useful,
while Professor Micheals
slept.</p>

<p>During the second week, Micheals
would wander around,
look at the trees and fish. By the
third week he would be getting a
tan, reading, repairing the sheds
and climbing mountains. At the
end of four weeks, he could hardly
wait to get back to the city.</p>

<p>But the resting week was sacred.</p>

<p>"I really wouldn't bother you
for anything small," Conners said
apologetically. "But that damned
rock melted two inches off my
spade."</p>

<p>Micheals opened both eyes and
sat up. Conners held out the
spade. The rounded end was
sheared cleanly off. Micheals
swung himself off the couch and
slipped his feet into battered moccasins.</p>

<p>"Let's see this wonder," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> object was lying in the
ditch at the end of the front
lawn, three feet from the main
road. It was round, about the size
of a truck tire, and solid throughout.
It was about an inch thick,
as far as he could tell, grayish
black and intricately veined.</p>

<p>"Don't touch it," Conners
warned.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to. Let me have
your spade." Micheals took the
spade and prodded the object experimentally.
It was completely
unyielding. He held the spade to
the surface for a moment, then
withdrew it. Another inch was
gone.</p>

<p>Micheals frowned, and pushed
his glasses tighter against his
nose. He held the spade against
the rock with one hand, the other
held close to the surface. More of
the spade disappeared.</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem to be generating
heat," he said to Conners. "Did
you notice any the first time?"</p>

<p>Conners shook his head.</p>

<p>Micheals picked up a clod of
dirt and tossed it on the object.
The dirt dissolved quickly, leaving
no trace on the gray-black
surface. A large stone followed
the dirt, and disappeared in the
same way.</p>

<p>"Isn't that just about the
damnedest thing you ever saw,
Professor?" Conners asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Micheals agreed, standing
up again. "It just about is."</p>

<p>He hefted the spade and
brought it down smartly on the
object. When it hit, he almost
dropped the spade. He had been
gripping the handle rigidly,
braced for a recoil. But the spade
struck that unyielding surface
and <i>stayed</i>. There was no perceptible
give, but absolutely no recoil.</p>

<p>"Whatcha think it is?" Conners
asked.</p>

<p>"It's no stone," Micheals said.
He stepped back. "A leech drinks
blood. This thing seems to be
drinking dirt. And spades." He
struck it a few more times, experimentally.
The two men looked
at each other. On the road,
half a dozen Army trucks rolled
past.</p>

<p>"I'm going to phone the college
and ask a physics man about it,"
Micheals said. "Or a biologist.
I'd like to get rid of that thing
before it spoils my lawn."</p>

<p>They walked back to the house.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Everything</span> fed the leech.
The wind added its modicum
of kinetic energy, ruffling across
the gray-black surface. Rain fell,
and the force of each individual
drop added to its store. The water
was sucked in by the all-absorbing
surface.</p>

<p>The sunlight above it was absorbed,
and converted into mass
for its body. Beneath it, the soil
was consumed, dirt, stones and
branches broken down by the
leech's complex cells and changed
into energy. Energy was converted
back into mass, and the leech
grew.</p>

<p>Slowly, the first flickers of consciousness
began to return. Its
first realization was of the impossible
smallness of its body.</p>

<p>It grew.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> Micheals looked the next
day, the leech was eight feet
across, sticking out into the road
and up the side of the lawn. The
following day it was almost eighteen
feet in diameter, shaped to fit
the contour of the ditch, and covering
most of the road. That day
the sheriff drove up in his model
A, followed by half the town.</p>

<p>"Is that your leech thing, Professor
Micheals?" Sheriff Flynn
asked.</p>

<p>"That's it," Micheals said. He
had spent the past days looking
unsuccessfully for an acid that
would dissolve the leech.</p>

<p>"We gotta get it out of the
road," Flynn said, walking truculently
up to the leech. "Something
like this, you can't let it
block the road, Professor. The
Army's gotta use this road."</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry," Micheals
said with a straight face. "Go
right ahead, Sheriff. But be careful.
It's hot." The leech wasn't
hot, but it seemed the simplest
explanation under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Micheals watched with interest
as the sheriff tried to shove a
crowbar under it. He smiled to
himself when it was removed with
half a foot of its length gone.</p>

<p>The sheriff wasn't so easily discouraged.
He had come prepared
for a stubborn piece of rock. He
went to the rumble seat of his car
and took out a blowtorch and a
sledgehammer, ignited the torch
and focused it on one edge of the
leech.</p>

<p>After five minutes, there was
no change. The gray didn't turn
red or even seem to heat up.
Sheriff Flynn continued to bake
it for fifteen minutes, then called
to one of the men.</p>

<p>"Hit that spot with the sledge,
Jerry."</p>

<p>Jerry picked up the sledgehammer,
motioned the sheriff
back, and swung it over his head.
He let out a howl as the hammer
struck unyieldingly. There wasn't
a fraction of recoil.</p>

<p>In the distance they heard the
roar of an Army convoy.</p>

<p>"Now we'll get some action,"
Flynn said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Micheals</span> wasn't so sure. He
walked around the periphery
of the leech, asking himself what
kind of substance would react
that way. The answer was easy&mdash;no
substance. No <i>known</i> substance.</p>

<p>The driver in the lead jeep
held up his hand, and the long
convoy ground to a halt. A hard,
efficient-looking officer stepped
out of the jeep. From the star on
either shoulder, Micheals knew
he was a brigadier general.</p>

<p>"You can't block this road,"
the general said. He was a tall,
spare man in suntans, with a sunburned
face and cold eyes.
"Please clear that thing away."</p>

<p>"We can't move it," Micheals
said. He told the general what
had happened in the past few
days.</p>

<p>"It must be moved," the general
said. "This convoy must go
through." He walked closer and
looked at the leech. "You say it
can't be jacked up by a crowbar?
A torch won't burn it?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Micheals said,
smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"Driver," the general said over
his shoulder. "Ride over it."</p>

<p>Micheals started to protest, but
stopped himself. The military
mind would have to find out in
its own way.</p>

<p>The driver put his jeep in gear
and shot forward, jumping the
leech's four-inch edge. The jeep
got to the center of the leech and
stopped.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you to stop!" the
general bellowed.</p>

<p>"I didn't, sir!" the driver protested.</p>

<p>The jeep had been yanked to a
stop and had stalled. The driver
started it again, shifted to four-wheel
drive, and tried to ram forward.
The jeep was fixed immovably,
as though set in concrete.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," Micheals said.
"If you look, you can see that the
tires are melting down."</p>

<p>The general stared, his hand
creeping automatically toward
his pistol belt. Then he shouted,
"Jump, driver! Don't touch that
gray stuff."</p>

<p>White-faced, the driver climbed
to the hood of his jeep, looked
around him, and jumped clear.</p>

<p>There was complete silence as
everyone watched the jeep. First
its tires melted down, and then
the rims. The body, resting on the
gray surface, melted, too.</p>

<p>The aerial was the last to go.</p>

<p>The general began to swear
softly under his breath. He turned
to the driver. "Go back and have
some men bring up hand grenades
and dynamite."</p>

<p>The driver ran back to the
convoy.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you've got
here," the general said. "But it's
not going to stop a U.S. Army
convoy."</p>

<p>Micheals wasn't so sure.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> leech was nearly awake
now, and its body was calling
for more and more food. It dissolved
the soil under it at a furious
rate, filling it in with its own
body, flowing outward.</p>

<p>A large object landed on it, and
that became food also. Then suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>A burst of energy against its
surface, and then another, and
another. It consumed them gratefully,
converting them into mass.
Little metal pellets struck it, and
their kinetic energy was absorbed,
their mass converted. More explosions
took place, helping to
fill the starving cells.</p>

<p>It began to sense things&mdash;controlled
combustion around it, vibrations
of wind, mass movements.</p>

<p>There was another, greater explosion,
a taste of <i>real</i> food!
Greedily it ate, growing faster.
It waited anxiously for more explosions,
while its cells screamed
for food.</p>

<p>But no more came. It continued
to feed on the soil and on the
Sun's energy. Night came, noticeable
for its lesser energy possibilities,
and then more days and
nights. Vibrating objects continued
to move around it.</p>

<p>It ate and grew and flowed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Micheals</span> stood on a little
hill, watching the dissolution
of his house. The leech was
several hundred yards across
now, lapping at his front porch.</p>

<p>Good-by, home, Micheals
thought, remembering the ten
summers he had spent there.</p>

<p>The porch collapsed into the
body of the leech. Bit by bit, the
house crumpled.</p>

<p>The leech looked like a field of
lava now, a blasted spot on the
green Earth.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," a soldier said,
coming up behind him. "General
O'Donnell would like to see you."</p>

<p>"Right," Micheals said, and
took his last look at the house.</p>

<p>He followed the soldier through
the barbed wire that had been
set up in a half-mile circle around
the leech. A company of soldiers
was on guard around it, keeping
back the reporters and the hundreds
of curious people who had
flocked to the scene. Micheals
wondered why he was still allowed
inside. Probably, he decided,
because most of this was
taking place on his land.</p>

<p>The soldier brought him to a
tent. Micheals stooped and went
in. General O'Donnell, still in
suntans, was seated at a small
desk. He motioned Micheals to a
chair.</p>

<p>"I've been put in charge of
getting rid of this leech," he said
to Micheals.</p>

<p>Micheals nodded, not commenting
on the advisability of
giving a soldier a scientist's job.</p>

<p>"You're a professor, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Anthropology."</p>

<p>"Good. Smoke?" The general
lighted Micheals' cigarette. "I'd
like you to stay around here in
an advisory capacity. You were
one of the first to see this leech.
I'd appreciate your observations
on&mdash;" he smiled&mdash;"the enemy."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to," Micheals said.
"However, I think this is more
in the line of a physicist or a biochemist."</p>

<p>"I don't want this place cluttered
with scientists," General
O'Donnell said, frowning at the
tip of his cigarette. "Don't get me
wrong. I have the greatest appreciation
for science. I am, if I do
say so, a scientific soldier. I'm
always interested in the latest
weapons. You can't fight any
kind of a war any more without
science."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">O'Donnell's</span> sunburned face
grew firm. "But I can't have
a team of longhairs poking
around this thing for the next
month, holding me up. My job
is to destroy it, by any means in
my power, and at once. I am going
to do just that."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll find it
that easy," Micheals said.</p>

<p>"That's what I want you for,"
O'Donnell said. "Tell me why
and I'll figure out a way of doing
it."</p>

<p>"Well, as far as I can figure
out, the leech is an organic mass-energy
converter, and a frighteningly
efficient one. I would guess
that it has a double cycle. First,
it converts mass into energy, then
back into mass for its body. Second,
energy is converted directly
into the body mass. How this
takes place, I do not know. The
leech is not protoplasmic. It may
not even be cellular&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So we need something big
against it," O'Donnell interrupted.
"Well, that's all right. I've
got some big stuff here."</p>

<p>"I don't think you understand
me," Micheals said. "Perhaps I'm
not phrasing this very well. <i>The
leech eats energy.</i> It can consume
the strength of any energy
weapon you use against it."</p>

<p>"What happens," O'Donnell
asked, "if it keeps on eating?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea what its
growth-limits are," Micheals
said. "Its growth may be limited
only by its food source."</p>

<p>"You mean it could continue
to grow probably forever?"</p>

<p>"It could possibly grow as long
as it had something to feed on."</p>

<p>"This is really a challenge,"
O'Donnell said. "That leech can't
be totally impervious to force."</p>

<p>"It seems to be. I suggest you
get some physicists in here. Some
biologists also. Have them figure
out a way of nullifying it."</p>

<p>The general put out his cigarette.
"Professor, I cannot wait
while scientists wrangle. There is
an axiom of mine which I am
going to tell you." He paused impressively.
"Nothing is impervious
to force. Muster enough
force and anything will give.
<i>Anything.</i></p>

<p>"Professor," the general continued,
in a friendlier tone, "you
shouldn't sell short the science
you represent. We have, massed
under North Hill, the greatest accumulation
of energy and radioactive
weapons ever assembled in
one spot. Do you think your leech
can stand the full force of them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it's possible to overload
the thing," Micheals said
doubtfully. He realized now why
the general wanted him around.
He supplied the trappings of science,
without the authority to
override O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Come with me," General
O'Donnell said cheerfully, getting
up and holding back a flap of the
tent. "We're going to crack that
leech in half."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After</span> a long wait, rich food
started to come again, piped
into one side of it. First there was
only a little, and then more and
more. Radiations, vibrations, explosions,
solids, liquids&mdash;an
amazing variety of edibles. It accepted
them all. But the food
was coming too slowly for the
starving cells, for new cells were
constantly adding their demands
to the rest.</p>

<p>The ever-hungry body screamed
for more food, faster!</p>

<p>Now that it had reached a fairly
efficient size, it was fully
awake. It puzzled over the energy-impressions
around it, locating
the source of the new food
massed in one spot.</p>

<p>Effortlessly it pushed itself into
the air, flew a little way and
dropped on the food. Its super-efficient
cells eagerly gulped the
rich radioactive substances. But
it did not ignore the lesser potentials
of metal and clumps of carbohydrates.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"The</span> damned fools," General
O'Donnell said. "Why did
they have to panic? You'd think
they'd never been trained." He
paced the ground outside his tent,
now in a new location three miles
back.</p>

<p>The leech had grown to two
miles in diameter. Three farming
communities had been evacuated.</p>

<p>Micheals, standing beside the
general, was still stupefied by the
memory. The leech had accepted
the massed power of the weapons
for a while, and then its entire
bulk had lifted in the air. The
Sun had been blotted out as it
flew leisurely over North Hill,
and dropped. There should have
been time for evacuation, but the
frightened soldiers had been blind
with fear.</p>

<p>Sixty-seven men were lost in
Operation Leech, and General
O'Donnell asked permission to
use atomic bombs. Washington
sent a group of scientists to investigate
the situation.</p>

<p>"Haven't those experts decided
yet?" O'Donnell asked, halting
angrily in front of the tent.
"They've been talking long
enough."</p>

<p>"It's a hard decision," Micheals
said. Since he wasn't an
official member of the investigating
team, he had given his information
and left. "The physicists
consider it a biological matter,
and the biologists seem to think
the chemists should have the answer.
No one's an expert on this,
because it's never happened before.
We just don't have the
data."</p>

<p>"It's a military problem,"
O'Donnell said harshly. "I'm not
interested in what the thing is&mdash;I
want to know what can destroy
it. They'd better give me permission
to use the bomb."</p>

<p>Micheals had made his own
calculations on that. It was impossible
to say for sure, but taking
a flying guess at the leech's
mass-energy absorption rate, figuring
in its size and apparent
capacity for growth, an atomic
bomb <i>might</i> overload it&mdash;if used
soon enough.</p>

<p>He estimated three days as the
limit of usefulness. The leech was
growing at a geometric rate. It
could cover the United States in
a few months.</p>

<p>"For a week I've been asking
permission to use the bomb,"
O'Donnell grumbled. "And I'll
get it, but not until after those
jackasses end their damned talking."
He stopped pacing and
turned to Micheals. "I am going
to destroy the leech. I am going
to smash it, if that's the last thing
I do. It's more than a matter of
security now. It's personal pride."</p>

<p>That attitude might make great
generals, Micheals thought, but
it wasn't the way to consider this
problem. It was anthropomorphic
of O'Donnell to see the leech as
an enemy. Even the identification,
"leech," was a humanizing factor.
O'Donnell was dealing with it as
he would any physical obstacle,
as though the leech were the simple
equivalent of a large army.</p>

<p>But the leech was not human,
not even of this planet, perhaps.
It should be dealt with in its own
terms.</p>

<p>"Here come the bright boys
now," O'Donnell said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">From</span> a nearby tent a group of
weary men emerged, led by
Allenson, a government biologist.</p>

<p>"Well," the general asked,
"have you figured out what it is?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute, I'll hack off a
sample," Allenson said, glaring
through red-rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you figured out some
<i>scientific</i> way of killing it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't too difficult,"
Moriarty, an atomic physicist,
said wryly. "Wrap it in a perfect
vacuum. That'll do the trick. Or
blow it off the Earth with anti-gravity."</p>

<p>"But failing that," Allenson
said, "we suggest you use your
atomic bombs, and use them
fast."</p>

<p>"Is that the opinion of your
entire group?" O'Donnell asked,
his eyes glittering.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The general hurried away. Micheals
joined the scientists.</p>

<p>"He should have called us in
at the very first," Allenson complained.
"There's no time to consider
anything but force now."</p>

<p>"Have you come to any conclusions
about the nature of the
leech?" Micheals asked.</p>

<p>"Only general ones," Moriarty
said, "and they're about the same
as yours. The leech is probably
extraterrestrial in origin. It seems
to have been in a spore-stage until
it landed on Earth." He paused
to light a pipe. "Incidentally, we
should be damned glad it didn't
drop in an ocean. We'd have had
the Earth eaten out from under
us before we knew what we were
looking for."</p>

<p>They walked in silence for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>"As you mentioned, it's a perfect
converter&mdash;it can transform
mass into energy, and any energy
into mass." Moriarty grinned.
"Naturally that's impossible and
I have figures to prove it."</p>

<p>"I'm going to get a drink," Allenson
said. "Anyone coming?"</p>

<p>"Best idea of the week," Micheals
said. "I wonder how long
it'll take O'Donnell to get permission
to use the bomb."</p>

<p>"If I know politics," Moriarty
said, "too long."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> findings of the government
scientists were checked by
other government scientists. That
took a few days. Then Washington
wanted to know if there
wasn't some alternative to exploding
an atomic bomb in the
middle of New York State. It
took a little time to convince
them of the necessity. After that,
people had to be evacuated, which
took more time.</p>

<p>Then orders were made out,
and five atomic bombs were
checked out of a cache. A patrol
rocket was assigned, given orders,
and put under General O'Donnell's
command. This took a day
more.</p>

<p>Finally, the stubby scout rocket
was winging its way over New
York. From the air, the grayish-black
spot was easy to find. Like
a festered wound, it stretched between
Lake Placid and Elizabethtown,
covering Keene and Keene
Valley, and lapping at the edges
of Jay.</p>

<p>The first bomb was released.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> had been a long wait after
the first rich food. The greater
radiation of day was followed by
the lesser energy of night many
times, as the leech ate away the
earth beneath it, absorbed the
air around it, and grew. Then one
day&mdash;</p>

<p>An amazing burst of energy!</p>

<p>Everything was food for the
leech, but there was always the
possibility of choking. The energy
poured over it, drenched it,
battered it, and the leech grew
frantically, trying to contain the
titanic dose. Still small, it quickly
reached its overload limit. The
strained cells, filled to satiation,
were given more and more food.
The strangling body built new
cells at lightning speed. And&mdash;</p>

<p>It held. The energy was controlled,
stimulating further
growth. More cells took over the
load, sucking in the food.</p>

<p>The next doses were wonderfully
palatable, easily handled.
The leech overflowed its bounds,
growing, eating, and growing.</p>

<p>That was a taste of real food!
The leech was as near ecstasy as
it had ever been. It waited hopefully
for more, but no more came.</p>

<p>It went back to feeding on the
Earth. The energy, used to produce
more cells, was soon dissipated.
Soon it was hungry
again.</p>

<p>It would always be hungry.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">O'Donnell</span> retreated with
his demoralized men. They
camped ten miles from the leech's
southern edge, in the evacuated
town of Schroon Lake. The leech
was over sixty miles in diameter
now and still growing fast. It lay
sprawled over the Adirondack
Mountains, completely blanketing
everything from Saranac
Lake to Port Henry, with one
edge of it over Westport, in Lake
Champlain.</p>

<p>Everyone within two hundred
miles of the leech was evacuated.</p>

<p>General O'Donnell was given
permission to use hydrogen
bombs, contingent on the approval
of his scientists.</p>

<p>"What have the bright boys
decided?" O'Donnell wanted to
know.</p>

<p>He and Micheals were in the
living room of an evacuated
Schroon Lake house. O'Donnell
had made it his new command
post.</p>

<p>"Why are they hedging?"
O'Donnell demanded impatiently.
"The leech has to be blown up
quick. What are they fooling
around for?"</p>

<p>"They're afraid of a chain reaction,"
Micheals told him. "A
concentration of hydrogen bombs
might set one up in the Earth's
crust or in the atmosphere. It
might do any of half a dozen
things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they'd like me to order
a bayonet attack," O'Donnell
said contemptuously.</p>

<p>Micheals sighed and sat down
in an armchair. He was convinced
that the whole method was
wrong. The government scientists
were being rushed into a single
line of inquiry. The pressure on
them was so great that they didn't
have a chance to consider any
other approach but force&mdash;and
the leech thrived on that.</p>

<p>Micheals was certain that there
were times when fighting fire with
fire was not applicable.</p>

<p>Fire. Loki, god of fire. And of
trickery. No, there was no answer
there. But Micheals' mind was in
mythology now, retreating from
the unbearable present.</p>

<p>Allenson came in, followed by
six other men.</p>

<p>"Well," Allenson said, "there's
a damned good chance of splitting
the Earth wide open if you
use the number of bombs our
figures show you need."</p>

<p>"You have to take chances in
war," O'Donnell replied bluntly.
"Shall I go ahead?"</p>

<p>Micheals saw, suddenly, that
O'Donnell didn't care if he did
crack the Earth. The red-faced
general only knew that he was
going to set off the greatest explosion
ever produced by the
hand of Man.</p>

<p>"Not so fast," Allenson said.
"I'll let the others speak for
themselves."</p>

<p>The general contained himself
with difficulty. "Remember," he
said, "according to your own figures,
the leech is growing at the
rate of twenty feet an hour."</p>

<p>"And speeding up," Allenson
added. "But this isn't a decision
to be made in haste."</p>

<p>Micheals found his mind wandering
again, to the lightning
bolts of Zeus. That was what
they needed. Or the strength of
Hercules.</p>

<p>Or&mdash;</p>

<p>He sat up suddenly. "Gentlemen,
I believe I can offer you a
possible alternative, although it's
a very dim one."</p>

<p>They stared at him.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of Antaeus?"
he asked.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> more the leech ate, the
faster it grew and the hungrier
it became. Although its
birth was forgotten, it did remember
a long way back. It had
eaten a planet in that ancient
past. Grown tremendous, ravenous,
it had made the journey to
a nearby star and eaten that, replenishing
the cells converted
into energy for the trip. But then
there was no more food, and the
next star was an enormous distance
away.</p>

<p>It set out on the journey, but
long before it reached the food,
its energy ran out. Mass, converted
back to energy to make the
trip, was used up. It shrank.</p>

<p>Finally, all the energy was
gone. It was a spore, drifting aimlessly,
lifelessly, in space.</p>

<p>That was the first time. Or was
it? It thought it could remember
back to a distant, misty time
when the Universe was evenly
covered with stars. It had eaten
through them, cutting away
whole sections, growing, swelling.
And the stars had swung off in
terror, forming galaxies and constellations.</p>

<p>Or was that a dream?</p>

<p>Methodically, it fed on the
Earth, wondering where the rich
food was. And then it was back
again, but this time above the
leech.</p>

<p>It waited, but the tantalizing
food remained out of reach. It
was able to sense how rich and
pure the food was.</p>

<p>Why didn't it fall?</p>

<p>For a long time the leech waited,
but the food stayed out of
reach. At last, it lifted and followed.</p>

<p>The food retreated, up, up from
the surface of the planet. The
leech went after as quickly as its
bulk would allow.</p>

<p>The rich food fled out, into
space, and the leech followed.
Beyond, it could sense an even
richer source.</p>

<p>The hot, wonderful food of a
sun!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">O'Donnell</span> served champagne
for the scientists in the
control room. Official dinners
would follow, but this was the
victory celebration.</p>

<p>"A toast," the general said,
standing. The men raised their
glasses. The only man not drinking
was a lieutenant, sitting in
front of the control board that
guided the drone spaceship.</p>

<p>"To Micheals, for thinking of&mdash;what
was it again, Micheals?"</p>

<p>"Antaeus." Micheals had been
drinking champagne steadily, but
he didn't feel elated. Antaeus,
born of Ge, the Earth, and Poseidon,
the Sea. The invincible
wrestler. Each time Hercules
threw him to the ground, he arose
refreshed.</p>

<p>Until Hercules held him in the
air.</p>

<p>Moriarty was muttering to
himself, figuring with slide rule,
pencil and paper. Allenson was
drinking, but he didn't look too
happy about it.</p>

<p>"Come on, you birds of evil
omen," O'Donnell said, pouring
more champagne. "Figure it out
later. Right now, drink." He turned
to the operator. "How's it going?"</p>

<p>Micheals' analogy had been
applied to a spaceship. The ship,
operated by remote control, was
filled with pure radioactives. It
hovered over the leech until, rising
to the bait, it had followed.
Antaeus had left his mother, the
Earth, and was losing his strength
in the air. The operator was allowing
the spaceship to run fast
enough to keep out of the leech's
grasp, but close enough to keep
it coming.</p>

<p>The spaceship and the leech
were on a collision course with
the Sun.</p>

<p>"Fine, sir," the operator said.
"It's inside the orbit of Mercury
now."</p>

<p>"Men," the general said, "I
swore to destroy that thing. This
isn't exactly the way I wanted to
do it. I figured on a more personal
way. But the important
thing is the destruction. You will
all witness it. Destruction is at
times a sacred mission. This is
such a time. Men, I feel wonderful."</p>

<p>"Turn the spaceship!" It was
Moriarty who had spoken. His
face was white. "Turn the damned
thing!"</p>

<p>He shoved his figures at them.</p>

<p>They were easy to read. The
growth-rate of the leech. The
energy-consumption rate, estimated.
Its speed in space, a
constant. The energy it would
receive from the Sun as it approached,
an exponential curve.
Its energy-absorption rate, figured
in terms of growth, expressed
as a hyped-up discontinuous
progression.</p>

<p>The result&mdash;</p>

<p>"It'll consume the Sun," Moriarty
said, very quietly.</p>

<p>The control room turned into
a bedlam. Six of them tried to
explain it to O'Donnell at the
same time. Then Moriarty tried,
and finally Allenson.</p>

<p>"Its rate of growth is so great
and its speed so slow&mdash;and it will
get so much energy&mdash;that the
leech will be able to consume the
Sun by the time it gets there. Or,
at least, to live off it until it can
consume it."</p>

<p>O'Donnell didn't bother to understand.
He turned to the operator.</p>

<p>"Turn it," he said.</p>

<p>They all hovered over the radar
screen, waiting.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> food turned out of the
leech's path and streaked
away. Ahead was a tremendous
source, but still a long way off.
The leech hesitated.</p>

<p>Its cells, recklessly expending
energy, shouted for a decision.
The food slowed, tantalizingly
near.</p>

<p>The closer source or the
greater?</p>

<p>The leech's body wanted food
<i>now</i>.</p>

<p>It started after it, away from
the Sun.</p>

<p>The Sun would come next.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Pull</span> it out at right angles to
the plane of the Solar System,"
Allenson said.</p>

<p>The operator touched the controls.
On the radar screen, they
saw a blob pursuing a dot. It had
turned.</p>

<p>Relief washed over them. It
had been close!</p>

<p>"In what portion of the sky
would the leech be?" O'Donnell
asked, his face expressionless.</p>

<p>"Come outside; I believe I can
show you," an astronomer said.
They walked to the door. "Somewhere
in that section," the astronomer
said, pointing.</p>

<p>"Fine. All right, Soldier,"
O'Donnell told the operator.
"Carry out your orders."</p>

<p>The scientists gasped in unison.
The operator manipulated
the controls and the blob began
to overtake the dot. Micheals
started across the room.</p>

<p>"Stop," the general said, and
his strong, commanding voice
stopped Micheals. "I know what
I'm doing. I had that ship especially
built."</p>

<p>The blob overtook the dot on
the radar screen.</p>

<p>"I told you this was a personal
matter," O'Donnell said. "I swore
to destroy that leech. We can
never have any security while it
lives." He smiled. "Shall we look
at the sky?"</p>

<p>The general strolled to the
door, followed by the scientists.</p>

<p>"Push the button, Soldier!"</p>

<p>The operator did. For a moment,
nothing happened. Then
the sky lit up!</p>

<p>A bright star hung in space.
Its brilliance filled the night,
grew, and started to fade.</p>

<p>"What did you do?" Micheals
gasped.</p>

<p>"That rocket was built around
a hydrogen bomb," O'Donnell
said, his strong face triumphant.
"I set it off at the contact moment."
He called to the operator
again. "Is there anything showing
on the radar?"</p>

<p>"Not a speck, sir."</p>

<p>"Men," the general said, "I
have met the enemy and he is
mine. Let's have some more
champagne."</p>

<p>But Micheals found that he
was suddenly ill.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> had been shrinking from the
expenditure of energy, when
the great explosion came. No
thought of containing it. The
leech's cells held for the barest
fraction of a second, and then
spontaneously overloaded.</p>

<p>The leech was smashed, broken
up, destroyed. It was split into a
thousand particles, and the particles
were split a million times
more.</p>

<p>The particles were thrown out
on the wave front of the explosion,
and they split further, spontaneously.</p>

<p>Into spores.</p>

<p>The spores closed into dry,
hard, seemingly lifeless specks of
dust, billions of them, scattered,
drifting. Unconscious, they floated
in the emptiness of space.</p>

<p>Billions of them, waiting to be
fed.</p>
